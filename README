Dockerized version of the Mattermost implementation of Mask R-CNN

Should only depend on having a working docker environment (and user
rights to run docker) an GPU drivers (CUDA) installed in the host
system.

The makefile contains everything needed for building and running,
specifically:

    make - builds the docker instance and drops you in a shell
    make .docker - only build the docker instance
    make train   - run a set of training epochs
    make test    - test the latest trained network

Most interesting configurations should be in the Makefile and in
src/config.py.

The default is configured to learn from the output of imagesim-docker.
